```{r}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
?datasaurus_dozen
```

## 1. Based on the help file, how many rows and how many columns does the datasaurus_dozen file have? What are the variables included in the data frame? (this can be hardcoded)
## there are 1846 rows and 3 columns. the variables included in the data frame are dataset, x, and y.
```{r question 2 code}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")
  
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()

dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
  
## 2. Plot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.
##-0.0645

```{r question 3 code}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")
  
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()

dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
  
## 3. Plot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?
## the correlation coef is -0.0630, which is slightly less than the correlation coef of the dino.

```{r question 4 code}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")
  
ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()

dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

## 4. Plot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?
## the correlation coef for the circle dataset is -0.0683, which is higher than the dino correlation coef

```{r question 5 code, fig.height=25, fig.width=20}
ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
datasaurus_dozen %>%
  group_by(dataset) %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

## 5. Finally, letâ€™s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of facetting.
```{r}
##i didnt mean to do this and idk how to delete it :()
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
